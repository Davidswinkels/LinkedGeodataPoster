    "# Concept\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> The concept of linked data is elegantly simple; storing relations and sharing individual resources via unique IRIs. Linked data is often visualized in a graph to show relations (see figure below) and the data is stored in relations as triples instead of values in columns and rows. A triple consists of three resources: a subject, a predicate and an object. The predicate defines the type of relation the subject and object have. Furthermore, each resource, whether that is a subject, predicate or object, is stored as an IRI. An IRI is an International Resource Identifier and similar as a Uniform Resource Identifier [URI] or Uniform Resource Locator [URL], but an IRI also allows international characters. Objects can optionally be stored as literals, such as a string, integer or date. Triples store relations in a framework called Resource Description Framework [RDF]. RDF supports data merging with different schemas and evolving schemas. Linked data allows a query to find out who the grandfather of Angie is based on semantic relations. </div>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> An RDF stores a vocabulary and instances. A vocabulary defines the concepts and relationships in an area of concern. Vocabularies store classes and properties.Instances are entities of classes. </div>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> Long IRIs, that link to unique resources, are shortened with a prefix to improve readability and save data storage. IRI 'http://www.dbpedia.org/ontology/Person' is shortened to dbo:Person. Dbo is the shortened prefix that links to the namespace 'http://www.dbpedia.org/ontology/' and Person is the unique ID or Class. Instead of having to say 'http://www.dbpedia.org/ontology/Mother', you can refer to the IRI as dbo:Mother. The prefix and namespaces are defined in the RDF file before the triple instances. The graph is stored as triples with namespaces and prefixes. These namespaces and prefixes can be re-used. This is very powerful, because the semantics are persistent and are used across domains. One public ontology is the building ontology from the land administration office in the Netherlands. This ontology stores all classes, properties, concepts, regulations and restrictions of building data as can be seen below. </div>\n"
